# :city_sunset: Picify :headphones:

**Picify** is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) application that converts your photos into Spotify playlists that can be saved for later listening.

## Resources
The app is based on the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), hosted on [Azure](https://portal.azure.com), and uses [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) to extract key terms from the image. It also finds semantically similar words that are frequently used to describe music via the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/), drawing from [AllMusic](https://www.allmusic.com/moods) and [Every Noise at Once](http://everynoise.com/genrewords.html).
